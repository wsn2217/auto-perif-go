Yahalom is an authentication and secure key-sharing protocol designed for use on an insecure network such as the Internet.
Yahalom uses a trusted arbitrator to distribute a shared key between two people. 
This protocol can be considered as an improved version of Wide Mouth Frog protocol 
(with additional protection against man-in-the-middle attack), 
but less secure than the Needham–Schroeder protocol.

If Alice (A) initiates communication with Bob (B), and S is a server trusted by both parties, 
the protocol can be specified as follows using security protocol notation:
	- A and B represent the identities of Alice and Bob, respectively.
	- Kas is a symmetric key known only to A and S.
	- Kbs is a symmetric key known only to B and S.
	- Na and Nb are nonces generated by A and B respectively.
	- Kab is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key for the session between A and B.

A --> B: A, Na
	Alice sends a message to Bob requesting communication, including her nonce Na.
B --> S: B, {A, Na, Nb}Kbs
	Bob sends a message to the Server encrypted with Kbs
S --> A: {B, Kab, Na, Nb}Kas, {A, Kab}Kbs
	The Server sends Alice a message containing the generated session key Kab and a message to be forwarded.
A --> B: {A, Kab}Kbs, {Nb}Kab
	Alice forwards the message to Bob and verifies Na has not changed. 
	Bob will verify Nb has not changed when he receives the message.
